    <h1>Winners of the 2024 Natural Landscape Photography Awards</h1>
    <p><em>Alan Taylor | September 17, 2024</em></p>
    <p>The winning images from the fourth annual <strong>Natural Landscape Photography Awards</strong> were just announced. The competition was started to <em>“promote the very best landscape photography by digital and film photographers who value realism and authenticity in their work,”</em> with rules set up to prevent deceptive editing techniques. A total of 1,134 photographers entered from 59 countries this year, in categories named “Grand Scenic,” “Intimate Landscapes,” and “Abstract & Details.” Contest organizers were once more kind enough to share their winners and runners-up.</p>

        <p>After a few days of the peaks of Beinn Eighe being hidden, the clouds finally lifted to reveal a light dusting of early snow. The weather was stormy, but occasional breaks in the cloud illuminated tiny patches of the autumnal grasses on the flanks of the mountain.</p>

        <p>The Northern Tasmanian forest is enveloped by the gentle mist of autumn, illuminated by the rising sun. As the leaves on a solitary tree are touched by sunlight, they release water droplets that merge with the surrounding mist, creating a stage for the tree to shine.</p>

        <p>During a troubling time for myself and the world, I retreated to the desert backcountry not too far from my home for solace. Through photography, I tried my best to convey the space, stillness, and silence that I found to be so liberating and nourishing.</p>
