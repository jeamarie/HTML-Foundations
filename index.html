    <h1>Winners of the 2024 Natural Landscape Photography Awards</h1>
    <p>Alan Taylor | September 17, 2024</p>
    <p>The winning images from the fourth annual <strong>Natural Landscape Photography Awards</strong> were just announced. The competition was started to <em>“promote the very best landscape photography by digital and film photographers who value realism and authenticity in their work,”</em> with rules set up to prevent deceptive editing techniques. A total of 1,134 photographers entered from 59 countries this year, in categories named “Grand Scenic,” “Intimate Landscapes,” and “Abstract & Details.” Contest organizers were once more kind enough to share their winners and runners-up.</p>
